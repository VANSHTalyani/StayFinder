# StayFinder

StayFinder is a full-stack web app, inspired by Airbnb, where users can list and book properties for short-term or long-term stays. This project is designed to give hands-on experience across both frontend and backend development.

StayFinder allows users to:
- Browse and search property listings
- View detailed property information
- Register and log in
- Book properties for desired dates
- (Optional) Hosts can manage their own listings

## ‚úÖ Objectives
Build a functional prototype with:
- **Frontend:** Property listing, search, details page, login/register
- **Backend:** RESTful API for listings, user authentication, and bookings
- **Database:** Store users, listings, and bookings
